# Overview

{As a software engineer, my goal is to deepen my understanding of web development and data visualization through practical projects. This project focuses on developing a map application that displays real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data for 20 districts in Peru. By creating this software, I am enhancing my skills in using JavaScript and integrating APIs, while also learning how to visualize data effectively}

{The map software I developed utilizes the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript to provides an interactive experience where users can view the AQI for 20 selected peruvian districts. Users can interact with the map through a search functionality and a locate widget, making it easier to find their location. The AQI data is sourced from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API, which provides real-time information on air quality based on geographical coordinates.}

{The purpose of writing this software is to raise awareness about air quality issues and honestly provide users with easy access to vital information that they might need. This tool not only serves as a learning experience for me but also aims to help my community by informing them about air quality levels in their area.}

# Development Environment

{* ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: This library provides powerful mapping capabilities and simplifies the process of adding maps and data layers to web applications
* HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web application, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across devices.}

{JavaScript: The language used for the logic and interactivity of the application.}

# Future Work

* Performance Optimization: Look for ways to reduce the number of API requests, potentially by using batch requests or caching data.
* User Interface Enhancements: Improve the overall design and usability of the application by adding features such as custom markers and animations.
* Data Visualization: Implement graphs or charts to visualize AQI trends over time for each district, providing users with a better understanding of air quality changes.
